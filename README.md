# Power BI Project

📊 Plant Co. Sales Performance Dashboard (2024)
📝 Project Description

This Power BI dashboard provides an end-to-end view of Plant Co.’s global sales performance for 2024. It compares Year-to-Date (YTD) sales with Prior Year-to-Date (PYTD), helping stakeholders 
evaluate business growth, identify underperforming regions, and track profitability across products and accounts.

The report includes multiple visualizations such as a Treemap for bottom 10 countries, a Waterfall chart for monthly variances, a Clustered Bar + Line chart for sales trends by product type, 
and a Scatter Plot for profitability segmentation. The dashboard also provides interactive filters for year selection (2022–2024) and KPI toggles (Sales, Quantity, Gross Profit).

🎯 Objective
